This is the official GitHub repo for the Create: Defensive addon by Cyerce and Aepherastudios for the Create mod by Simibubi.
Create: Defensive is an addon that introduces a ton of new features to Minecraft such as armors for underepresented materials, armor sets past Netherite, and custom weapons.
Many of the weapons have their own custom features, such as multiple being able to lacerate victims, or the Morningstar doing more damage to armor than other weapons, or hammers slowing and nauseating your victims.
The mod also comes with other features like custom arrows that do more damage, hammers and excavators that mine 3x3, and spears that you can throw
